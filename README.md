## Business question:
Where are the best value money places to stay in NYC?

### More Details
In order to get to the conclusion, I tried to understand the context and the perspective of the customers first. Customers have different preferences and purpose of renting an airbnb property. 
Then I created 3 categories of properties that are based from the number of beds a property can accomodate. 
Those 3 categories are:
- Solo travellers (1 bed)
- Family & Friends (2-5 beds)
- Big groups (> 5 beds)

I also filtered out the properties that have less than 40 reviews to only count the ones with the properties that have been maintained well for a long time. I haven't included the properties that were new
since it would become a bit unfair if their reviews are only a few and I wouldn't know if the owners can maintin their properties for a long time.
